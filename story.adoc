this is a story of a dog and a cat.
they can not live without eachother.
But they fight like fierce enemies.
Until one day, there is a mouse appears.
This mouse was so strong and clever
that he beats both the cat and the dog.

It was a mighty mous with a lots of friends.
They used to play often in the woods *hide and seek*.
But the mouse wasn't *happy* at all.

 14 The mouse turned out to be a flying cloud
 15 Light as fluff, fast as the wind
 16 None could stand in it's way
 17 As he kept floating, and floating...

and then the guy said : "omae wa mo shindeiru"
and it was at this moment hat he knew
he fucked up.
