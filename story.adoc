this is a story of a dog and a cat.
they can not live without eachother.
But they fight like fierce enemies.
Until one day, there is a mouse appears.
This mouse was so strong and clever
that he beats both the cat and the dog.

It was a mighty mous with a lots of friends.
They used to play often in the woods *hide and seek*.
But This louse wasn't *happy* at all.
